# Punch to activate mode
By default, all armour stands will show the hologram. This can cause lag and annoyance if playing in an area with lots of armour stands placed already.

To change this behaviour, in the resource pack settings, you can select the "Punch to activate" subpack. This will make armour stands hide the hologram until you interact with them by punching.

In this mode, newly-placed armour stands won't show anything until punched. This allows you to interact normally with armour stands and select only the ones you want to show a hologram.
